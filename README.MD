A basic Tic-Tac-Toe game utilizing module patterns and immediately invoked function expressions, as well as factory functions. My goal with this was to keep as many methods and variables as I could private. I didn't use minimax for the game's Ai but it is unbeatable. Basically I wrote something similar which scores each move which is basically the player's winning move, opponent's winning move, the center tile, corner tiles, and then random tiles from highest to lowest in that order.  If you would like to watch the Ai play itself type in Ai for player name.  

The layout is just some basic bootstrap and css stuff i quickly threw together.
